- 👋 Hi, I’m @1889ca, also known as MCM.
- 👀 I’m interested in weird ideas in the React/Vue and NFT space. I do a lot of dogfood projects, and especially enjoy formalizing well-trod informalities so they can go in strange new directions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to switch my brain between React, Vue and Laravel (with and without Typescript in the mix) while not forgetting the fun of just writing a really dumb shell script to re-org my downloads folder completely unnecessarily.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need sideways thinking in small bursts. I have a short attention span, but like to burn intensely on a single problem for as long as it takes.
- 📫 How to reach me: mcm@1889.ca. You can also check out my website at mcm.1889.ca, if you're feeling especially bored.
